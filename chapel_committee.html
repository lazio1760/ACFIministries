Ushering is a lot more than showing or leading people to their seats in the church. Ushering is a ministry that meets the spiritual and physical needs of the church. When you usher at any of ACFI Churches, you are the first person a visitor meets when coming in the door. Your greeting of friendship and spirit of helpfulness conveys that very important first impression. Members and friends of the Church also look forward to your welcome. Whatever you can do to make people feel welcome will support their receptivity to the service of worship. Think of your role as that of a host or hostess welcoming a guest into your home. Time for you to arrive at the church is very important in this situation. You would need to be at the church at least thrity minutes before the service begins, even the Sunday school. Ushers' responsibilities include the following:<br />
<br />


1.) To ensure that the people are humbly conducted into the Chapel/Church Hall.<br />
<br />


2.) To give to each person as they enter the Church, the program's Leaflet, Sunday school materials, Offering envelopes, and any other information they may need for the worship.<br />
