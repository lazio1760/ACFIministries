 <b><u>Preamble</u></b><br />
<br />

The following document is an explanation of the official rules and regulations of the Ministry, as well as the Administrative Structure.   There is no doubt that we are living in era of inconsistency, lawlessness and confusion where Churches and Ministries are without standard and the password is ‘I’ll do it my own way’.  The Leadership of this Ministry recognises these fact and what we demand is discipleship with integrity, whose character is uncorrupted, whose doctrine is sound, whose relationship with God and man are real, whose thought are pure, whose vision is progressive, whose loyalty is sure and whose life is fixed on God.<br />
<br />

These attributes enumerated above, serves as the framework for choosing our Workers and Collaborators.  Suffice is to say that, it is not the policy of the Ministry to look for volunteers rather, we are looking forward only to receiving people with Spiritual Conviction of being called of God to serve in this particular Ministry.   The basis for choosing our Workers and Collaborators therefore could be inferred from the Bible (Luke chapter 6:12-16).   In this scripture, Jesus called His disciples to Himself and from them He choose twelve whom He also named Apostles.  May the Lord grant you a sincere heart to make a quality decision to serve in His Vineyard. <br />
