 All Christians' Fellowship International is a Ministry that have grown by the will of God for the propagation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ all over the world; establishing and maintaining a place for the worship of one true God; to provide Christian Fellowship for people of different Christian denominations and nations and for those of like precious faith, irrespective of social position or worldly possessions by the conviction of the Lord Jesus Christ to:
 <ul style="font-size: 13px; font-style: italic;"><li>Proclaim the Gospel to all nations (Matthew 28:19)</li>
 <li>Preach good news to the poor</li>
 <li>Bind up the broken-hearted</li>
 <li>Proclain freedom for the captives and release for the prisoners (Isiah 61:1)</li></ul>
 Inevitably, this document includes certain affirmations about Christ Faith and Gospel.  It is not meant to compel assents or to replace the confession of faith of other Evangelical, Pentecostal or Charismatic Churches across the World; rather it is descriptive of <i>(i) Central matters of faith (ii) Conduct governing this Ministry</i> - ALL CHRISTIANS’ FELLOWSHIP INTERNATIONAL (ACFI). It is noteworthy, however, that (ACFI) is basically an Evangelistic Oriented Ministry and our vision as seen above is to "Preach the Word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, and exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching."<br /><br />
 We believe that the Bible is the word of God and that all statements in it are truly stated and are of relevance from generation to generations.  We are quite aware of the existence of many denominations and their different doctrines and beliefs.  However, in order to maintain unity among the genuine Christians in the body of Christ, the Bible is our only standard and Jesus Christ is our great example.  <br /><br />
 We believe that Christian fellowship, mutual edification and evangelical effort, in and through the form and body of local churches is God’s ordained order for His people, and, that those of each local Church are enjoined to assemble themselves together for Worship, Fellowship, Counsel, and Instruction in the Word of God, and the work of the ministry; and for the exercising of those mutual gifts and offices provided for in the New Testament; and that the local Church is charged by the Word of God and the light of that Word by the Spirit in all godly fear and love; and believing that those things are essential to obtaining the Christian goal, “Be ye therefore holy even as your Father in heaven is holy;” and further, believing that God has called us, anointing us to emphasize the fullness of the Gospel in and through the Baptism of Water and with the Holy Ghost <i>(which is our distinctive testimony)</i> according to the scriptures; <i>(John 3:5; Acts 1:4-5, 2:4, 2:38, 8:36-37, 10:44-48, 19:2,6; Matthew 28:19)</i>.<br /><br />
 Therefore we have accepted the following Statement of Fundamental Truths and have adopted the By-Laws, which do herein appear.  We shall seek, by the grace of God, to be governed by the By-Laws as are herein set forth and will also seek to teach and propagate the doctrines as are contained in the Statement of Fundamental Truths.<br /><br />
